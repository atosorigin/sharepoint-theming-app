# SharePoint Theming App
This repo contains the source code for an app that styles a SharePoint (2013 and up) site to look like an Atos branded site. Disclaimer: althought the styling looks a lot like our corporate website, it has not officially been cleared by our branding office. This project is meant for demonstration purposes only.


### JavaScript (JSOM) provisioning
The project deploys the branding completely using JSOM. There's no server side code. This means everything runs from the browser and doesn't require any additional servers or resources, SharePoint will host the app for you (provided your environment has been set-up to be app-enabled.

### Installation guide
Installation is as easy as adding the app package to your app catalog; deploying it to a site and hitting the button. It might take a  minute or two to get everything deployed.
